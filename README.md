## Ultra private browser, even more private than librewolf, because we don't even have a server to keep your data, so it's super private. This browser uses DuckDuckGo as a search engine! We don't collect any type of telementry or user passwords. It is open-source. You can see the whole code. We are working on OneWeb 2. We plan to add keep my password that will be stored on a super hidden folder in your computer.
